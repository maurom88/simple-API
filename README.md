# Simple API usage with JavaScript

---

The API that this project originally relied on doesn't exist anymore. The new API is [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/).

---

This app was created by following Tania Rascia's tutorial at https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/ and (formerly) using the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/).

The repository was created for students to help them with some basic concepts of frontend web development (see the `broken-app` branch for an example.)
